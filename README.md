# Movies Database
This project is a movie database for our Internet Engineering course instructed by [Parham Alvani](https://github.com/1995parham). It was mainly about managing access management. There are 3 types of users.
* **Admins**: they have the following accesses:
  * Add a new movie
  * Edit a movie
  * Remove a movie
  * Accept or reject comment of a user

* **Normal User**: can do the following:
  * Vote for a movie
  * Submit comments for movies

* **Guest User**:
  * See the list of movies
  * See movie's information
  * See other user's comments

There is no UI for this project, so you should use Postman or other tools for dealing with requests. You can see the process in screenshots [here](https://github.com/Amirhossein-Rajabpour/Movies-Database/blob/master/screenshots.pdf)
